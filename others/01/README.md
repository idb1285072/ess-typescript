# TypeScript
- Superset of JavaScript
- Static Typing and modern features

# Why TypeScript?
- catch error before running the code/early error detection
- TypeScript supports the latest ES6+ features and compiles them into JavaScript that works in older browsers
- great for large-scale applications

# Environment SetUp
```bash
npm install -g typescript
tsc file.ts
```

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
npx tsc file.ts
```
